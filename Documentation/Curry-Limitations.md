# `curry` limitations

It is very important to fully curry your model’s `init` in order to use Argo.
Because of this, Our recommended best practice is to use [Curry] which allows
you to change your standard `init` functions into fully curried functions.
Unfortunately, The Swift compiler can currently only handle compiling `curry`
for around 20 arguments in a reasonable amount of time. That may sound like a
lot, but one can still run up against this limitation quite quickly,
especially when you are not in control of the JSON API you are interfacing
with.

The solution is to try to find a way to normalize your data into nested models,
thus reducing the number of arguments needed for `init`. For simplicity, assume
for a moment that `curry` was only defined for functions of 5 arguments or less,
and consider the following model:

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
  let bio: String
  let smallAvatar: String
  let mediumAvatar: String
  let largeAvatar: String

  static func decode(v: Value) -> Decoded<User> {
    return curry(User.init)
      <^> v <| "id"
      <*> v <| "name"
      <*> v <| "bio"
      <*> v <| "small_avatar"
      <*> v <| "medium_avatar"
      <*> v <| "large_avatar"
  }
}
```

With our assumption on `curry`, we would get a Swift compiler error when doing
`curry(User.init)` because `User.init` takes 6 arguments. Even though the API
has decided to send back separate fields for each avatar size, we can
normalize this response by introducing a new `Avatar` type.

```swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
  let bio: String
  let avatar: Avatar
}

struct Avatar {
  let small: String
  let medium: String
  let large: String
}
```

Now `User.init` has 4 arguments and `Avatar.init` has 3 arguments, so we are
within the assumed limitations of `curry`. But, it is also less clear how we
should write `User.decode`. How can we extract the 3 avatar fields from `Value`
to build `Avatar` first, and then use that to build `User`? The key insight is
to see that `j <| "key"` returns a `Decoded<T>` value, representing one step
of decoding. So, we can decode a `Avatar` first using `j`, and then plug that
directly into `curry(User.init)`:

```swift
extension Avatar: Decodable {
  static func decode(v: Value) -> Decoded<Avatar> {
    return curry(Avatar.init)
      <^> v <| "small_avatar"
      <*> v <| "medium_avatar"
      <*> v <| "large_avatar"
  }
}

extension User: Decodable {
  static func decode(v: Value) -> Decoded<User> {
    return curry(User.init)
      <^> v <| "id"
      <*> v <| "name"
      <*> v <| "bio"
      <*> Avatar.decode(v)
  }
}
```

We have now successfully gotten around `curry`’s limitations, and also
produced a better, normalized model! We also retain all of the great error
handling that Argo provides, so if there is a decoding error in `Avatar` it
will propagate through to a decoding error in `User`.
