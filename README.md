Argo
====

The Greek word for _swift_ and the ship used by Jason, son of Aeson, of the
Argonauts. Aeson is the JSON parsing library in Haskell that inspired Argo,
much like Aeson inspired his son Jason.

NOTE: The master branch of Argo is pushing ahead with Swift 1.2 support.
Support for Swift 1.1 can be found on branch [swift-1.1] and in the 0.3.x
versions of tags/releases.

[swift-1.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/tree/swift-1.1

## Installation

### [Carthage]

[Carthage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

Add the following to your Cartfile:

```
github "thoughtbot/Argo"
```

Then run `carthage update`.

Follow the current instructions in [Carthage's README][carthage-installation]
for up to date installation instructions.

[carthage-installation]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application

You'll also need to add `Runes.framework` to your project. [Runes] is a
dependency of Argo, so you don't need to specify it in your Cartfile.

[Runes]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/runes

### [CocoaPods]

[CocoaPods]: http://cocoapods.org

__DISCLAIMER: CocoaPods doesn't officially support Swift projects yet. Use the
pre-release version at your own discretion.__

Add the following to your [Podfile](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```ruby
pod 'Argo', :git => 'https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo'
```

Then run `pod install` with CocoaPods 0.36 or newer.

### Git Submodules

I guess you could do it this way if that's your thing.

Add this repo as a submodule, and add the project file to your workspace. You
can then link against `Argo.framework` for your application target.

You'll also need to add [Runes] to your project the same way.

## Usage tl;dr:

```swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
  let email: String?
  let role: Role
  let companyName: String
  let friends: [User]
}

extension User: JSONDecodable {
  static func create(id: Int)(name: String)(email: String?)(role: Role)(companyName: String)(friends: [User]) -> User {
    return User(id: id, name: name, email: email, role: role, companyName: companyName, friends: friends)
  }

  static func decode(j: JSON) -> User? {
    return User.create
      <^> j <| "id"
      <*> j <| "name"
      <*> j <|? "email" // Use ? for parsing optional values
      <*> j <| "role" // Custom types that also conform to JSONDecodable just work
      <*> j <| ["company", "name"] // Parse nested objects
      <*> j <|| "friends" // parse arrays of objects
  }
}

// Wherever you receive JSON data:

let json: AnyObject? = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions(0), error: .None)

if let j: AnyObject = json {
  let value = JSON.parse(j)
  let user = User.decode(value)
}
```

## Ideology

Argo's core concept is that in order to maintain type safety, you should only
be able to successfully decode an object if all parameters are satisfied
properly. So if you have a model that looks like this:

```swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
}
```

but the JSON you receive from the server looks like this:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "this isn't a number",
    "name": "Gob Bluth"
  }
}
```

you would want that JSON parsing to fail and return `.None` instead of a
`User` object. That base concept means that when you're dealing with an actual
`User` object, you can be sure that when you ask for `user.id`, you're going
to get the type you expect.

If you're interested in learning more about the concepts and ideology that
went into building Argo, we recommend reading the series of articles that were
written alongside its development:

- [Real World JSON Parsing with Swift](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/real-world-json-parsing-with-swift)
- [Parsing Embedded JSON and Arrays in Swift](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/parsing-embedded-json-and-arrays-in-swift)

## Functional Concepts

Argo really wants to be used with patterns borrowed from functional
programming such as `map` and `apply`. We feel that these patterns greatly
reduce the pain felt in trying to use JSON (an inherently loosely typed
format) with Swift (a strictly typed language). It also gives us a way to
succinctly maintain the core concept described above, and short circuit the
decoding process if any part of it fails.

Additionally, we feel that the use of operators for these functions greatly
improves the readability of the code we're suggesting. Using named functions
would lead to nested functions and a confusing number of parenthesis.

If you aren't familiar with how these functions work (or just aren't
comfortable with using operators), that's totally OK. It's possible to use the
library without using them, although it might be a little more painful.

If you're looking to learn more about these functions, we would recommend
reading the following articles:

- [Railway Oriented Programming](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/)

## Usage

The first thing you need to do when you receive JSON data is convert it to an
instance of the `JSON` enum. This is done by passing the `AnyObject`
value returned from `NSJSONSerialization` to `JSON.parse()`:

```swift
let json: AnyObject? = NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData(responseData, options: NSJSONReadingOptions(0), error: nil)

if let j: AnyObject = json {
  let value: JSON = JSON.parse(j)
  let user: User? = User.decode(value)
}
```

Note that you probably want to use an error pointer to track errors from
`NSJSONSerialization`.

The `JSON` enum exists to help with some of the type inference, and also
wraps up some of the casting that we'll need to to to transform the JSON into
native types.

Next, you need to make sure that models that you wish to decode from JSON
conform to the `JSONDecodable` protocol:

```swift
public protocol JSONDecodable {
  typealias DecodedType = Self
  class func decode(JSON) -> DecodedType?
}
```

You will need to implement the `decode` function to perform any kinds of
transformations you need to transform your model from a JSON value. A simple
implementation for an enum value might look like:

```swift
enum RoleType: String {
  case Admin = "Admin"
  case User = "User"
}

extension RoleType: JSONDecodable {
  static func decode(j: JSON) -> RoleType? {
    switch j {
    case let .String(s): return RoleType(rawValue: s)
    default: return .None
    }
  }
}
```

The real power of Argo can be seen when decoding actual model objects. To
illustrate this, we will decode the simple `User` object that we used earlier.

Create your model normally:

```swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
}
```

You will also want to create a curried creation function. This is needed
because of a deficiency in Swift that doesn't allow us to pass `init`
functions around like other functions.

```swift
extension User {
  static func create(id: Int)(name: String) -> User {
    return User(id: id, name: name)
  }
}
```

Using this curried syntax will allow us to partially apply the function over
the course of the decoding process. If you'd like to learn more about
currying, we recommend the following articles:

- [Apple's documentation of curried functions](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH34-XID_615)
- [Introduction to Function Currying in Swift](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/introduction-to-function-currying-in-swift)

The last thing to do will be to conform to `JSONDecodable` and implement the
required `decode` function. We will implement this function by using `map`
(`<^>`) and `apply` (`<*>`) to conditionally pass the required parameters to
the creation function. The common pattern will look like:

```swift
return Model.create <^> paramOne <*> paramTwo <*> paramThree
```

and so on. If any of those parameters are `.None`, the entire creation process
will fail, and the function will return `.None`. If all of the parameters are
`.Some(value)`, the value will be unwrapped and passed to the creation
function.

In order to help with the decoding process, Argo introduces two new operators
for parsing a value out of the JSON:

- `<|` will attempt to parse a single value from the JSON
- `<||` will attempt to parse an array of values from the JSON

The usage of these operators is the same regardless:

- `json <| "key"` will decode the value for the key "key"
- `json <| ["key", "nested"]` will decode the value at '{ "key": { "nested"'

Both operators will attempt to decode the value from the JSON into the
expected type. If it can't find a value, or if that value is of the wrong
type, the function will return `.None`.

There are also Optional versions of these operators:

- `<|?` will attempt to parse an optional value from the JSON
- `<||?` will attempt to parse an optional array of values from the JSON

Usage is the same as the non-optionals. The difference is that if these fail
parsing, the parsing continues. This is useful for including parameters that
truly are optional values. For example, if your system doesn't require someone
to supply an email address, you could have an optional property: `let email:
String?` and parse it with `json <|? "email"`.

So to implement our `decode` function, we can use the JSON parsing operator in
conjunction with `map` and `apply`:

```swift
extension User: JSONDecodable {
  static func decode(j: JSON) -> User? {
    return User.create
      <^> j <| "id"
      <*> j <| "name"
  }
}
```

For comparison, this same function without Argo would look like so:

```swift
extension User {
  static func decode(j: NSDictionary) -> User? {
    if let id = j["id"] as Int {
      if let name = j["name"] as String {
        return User(id: id, name: name)
      }
    }
  }

  return .None
}
```

You could see how this would get much worse with a more complex model.

You can decode custom types the same way, as long as the type also conforms to
`JSONDecodable`.
